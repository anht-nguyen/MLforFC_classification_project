# MLforFC Classification Project

Welcome to the MLforFC Classification Project repository. This project focuses on developing machine learning models for classifying functional connectivity (FC) based on two distinct tasks:

## Classification Tasks

1. **AO Conditions Classification**: Classify different Action Observation (AO) conditions.
2. **Action Type Classification**: Classify various types of observed actions.

Explore the repository to learn more about the models and methodologies used for these classification tasks.

## NOTE !!!

Update 5/16/2025:

The evaluation metrics are current incorrect, as the specificity and sensitivity are for binary classification.
For multi-class classification in this study, we need to compute metrics like : 
- TP, FP, TN, and FN per class
- Accuracy
- Precision (P)
- Recall (R)
- F1 score (F1)
- Area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve or simply AUC (AUC)
