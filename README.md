# MLforFC Classification Project

Welcome to the MLforFC Classification Project repository. This project focuses on developing machine learning models for classifying functional connectivity (FC) based on two distinct tasks:

## Classification Tasks

1. **AO Conditions Classification**: Classify different Action Observation (AO) conditions.
2. **Action Type Classification**: Classify various types of observed actions.

Explore the repository to learn more about the models and methodologies used for these classification tasks.
